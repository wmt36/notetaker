# Title
Note Taker

## Objective

The objective of this project was to allow the user with a simple note pad that saved the user input to a database, which was also used to render on the side bar onnce the note was created! The bulk o the application was taliord to backend development which challenegd me to start up a server which i was successful with! 


## challenges

As with any project there were many challenges that i faced with this one but was able to over come the bulk of them in order to get as far as i was able to. The last challenege that i cant seem to get coded in yet is when i click the delete button it doesnt delete the exact note but all of the notes. will spend more time figuring it out and will get the last bit figured out!
